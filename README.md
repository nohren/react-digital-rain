# react-digital-rain
This is an implementation using gifs positioned statically in columns and rows and timed to start staggered.  I.e when the current row gif is triggered once the digital rain drop of the proceeding row meets it.  This results in a rather seamless animation that adapts to the layout viewport, visual viewport and full screen. .
